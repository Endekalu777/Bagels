Bagels is a classic guessing game that challenges players to decipher a hidden three-digit number. The objective of the game is to guess the number correctly within a limited number of attempts. Each time the player makes a guess, they receive feedback to help them refine their next guess.

How to Play:

Objective: Guess the secret three-digit number.
Rules:
The secret number contains three unique digits (no repeating digits).
The first digit cannot be zero.
The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the number.
Gameplay:
At the start of the game, the program generates a secret three-digit number.
The player makes a guess by entering a three-digit number.
After each guess, the player receives feedback in the form of "Bagels," "Pico," and "Fermi" clues:
"Bagels": None of the guessed digits match any digit in the secret number.
"Pico": A guessed digit is in the secret number, but not in the correct position.
"Fermi": A guessed digit is in the correct position.
Based on the feedback, the player refines their next guess.
The game continues until the player correctly guesses the secret number or runs out of attempts.
Outcome:
If the player guesses the number within the allotted attempts, they win the game.
If the player exhausts all attempts without guessing the number correctly, they lose the game.
